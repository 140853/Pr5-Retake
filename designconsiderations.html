      <h6> Colour & Font choice </h6>
      <p> Choosing the right colours is very important: You don't want it to be straining on the eyes and you want to maintain a strong sense of contrast so that everything is still legible. For our background we went with a dark green which doesn't distract the user from the content on the page. It also ensures that you can open our page at any time of the day, even at night, so your retinas do not get hurt by sudden bright light coming from your monitor or cell phone. We also want the site to be nice to look at when you are at an indoor concert and you want to look up some quick information about the bands playing, so no extremely bright segments. Red text is used to grab the readers' attention and white text is to ensure legibility through contrast. The colourcodes for Red, white and the background are: R=255 G=0 B=0 , R=255 G=255 B=255 , R=47 G=79 B=79 respectively (or #FF0000 , #FFFFFF , #2f4f4f). The legal warning is R=139, B=0 , G=0 (or #8b0000) to ensure that this stand out even more as it's so important. We chose the Courier Prime Font because it looks like a typewriter has written the text and we want to create nostalgia for the reader back to the time when music was still good.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h6> Testing method </h6>
      <p> In order to ensure a varied sample size we have asked people from different ages and technical know-how to do usability testing for our website while recording their screen and audio. They gave consent to being recorded and their release forms can be found in a link down below. We have asked two youngsters who primarily utilize their mobile phone to navigate the web (Tina and Danny). One millenial who has experience with both mobile and desktop browsing (Pieter) and two 50+ participants (Marjolein and Peter). During the test they were given a set of objectives they would have to fulfill while voicing their thoughts (The Think aloud method) so we could hear the considerations they took into navigating the site and to pinpoint where we could make our improvements. <br> 
      The transcribed interviews can be found here: Transcripts <br>
      The full uncut interviews can be found here: Video interviews <br>
      Their release forms can be found here: Release forms</p>

    </div>

<div class="col-md-6">
      <h6> Findings & Suggestions</h6>
      <p> The younger participants had no issues with the navigation of the site, especially after they had familiarized themselves with the layout. The older participants did have some issues though. For Marjolein it was not very clear that by clicking the BredaTunes logo you would return back to the homepage. Peter struggled with using the Macbook and the gestures necessary to navigate the page using the touchpad and the associated gestures, having used Windows all his life and used to a physical mouse. At one point he accidentally used the swipe gesture to return to the homepage which was purely accidental. <br>
      Design wise everyone had some issues though, the most glaring issue was the box at the bottom of the home page containing the About Us link, Pieter and Danny thought it looked bad. Marjolein and Peter recommended a way to navigate back to the homepage at the bottom of each webpage so that the user doesn't have to scroll back up to do so. Peter also said the images used on the homepage that navigate to Our Licenses weren't clear. The images in the 'Our bands' carousel were obviously bands but he did not recognize all the album covers used in the licenses carousel.  <br>
    Looking at the "5 Es of usability": The product is effective, all test participants were able to do and navigate what they wanted. The navigationflow is efficient but of course could always be improved upon. The users generally seemed to like the look of the site and the carrousels on the main page were engaging. The site is Error tolerant, there are no crazy things that can be clicked that malfunction the site. The navigation is easy to learn. </p>

    </div>

    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h6> Implementations </h6>
      <p> As suggested by Marjolein a link was added in the footer of each page along with the copyright notice to quickly navigate back to the homepage. The link to go back to the homepage will still remain in the logo at the top of the page. This way people who are used to navigating a site this way will still be able to do so. We have moved the link to the about us page to a button next to the reviews button. This way the black box at the bottom is only used for a disclaimer and not for any unique navigation.</p>
        <p>Peter's difficulty using the touchpad can only be solved by hooking up a mouse but unfortunately that was not possible at the time. A couple of different images that look more like licenses have been used for the 'Our licenses' carousel to make it more clear from just the image what it will link to. </p> <br>
        <h6> Recommendations </h6>
       <p> Luckily the entire site doesn't have to be reworked and the feedback given from the users was more about small distractions or inefficiencies. There are however certain changes that we've made and that can still be made in the future to improve upon. Make the BredaTunes logo always stay in the top header wherever you scroll to help with the ease of navigating. Danny recommended more colour but that goes against our current design philosophy but it is something to consider for additional webpages we might add on. Pieter recommended a dropdown menu for navigations, we'll consider adding this when more pages are added and the current navigation style becomes cumbersome.

      <h6> Prototypes and earlier versions </h6>
      <p> As with any great product it has to be thought up, go through the designing phase and then a prototype phase. Here you can enjoy some sketches we made visualizing how we wanted our site to look like as well as some VERY early screenshots so you can appreciate the evolution our site has been through.
